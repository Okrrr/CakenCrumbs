        <h2>From Passion to Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          My love for baking began in my home kitchen, where experimenting with recipes
          turned into a deep passion for creating delicious, handcrafted treats. A memorable
          turning point came last Christmas when my brother and I baked a special cake and cookies
          for our family — seeing the joy our creations brought made me realize this was more
          than just a hobby; it was my calling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of enrolling in a baking school, I chose to invest directly in my dream — buying
          my first oven and turning my kitchen into my classroom. On June 19th, 2025, I launched my
          baking business while continuing my university studies. Each day, I learn, refine my
          techniques, and share my baked goods with fellow students and the community, one sweet
          creation at a time.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At Cake N Crumbs, I believe in quality over quantity — every cake, cookie, and loaf
      is made with care, using fresh ingredients and a sprinkle of creativity. My goal is
      to bring people together through the warmth and joy of homemade baking.
